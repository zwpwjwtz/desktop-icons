# Chinese (Simplified) Translation for Desktop Icons
 
This is a set of .desktop files which usually serve as the launcher icons of Linux desktop.
 
Due to some reasons, many entries were left with uncompleted localization. This can greatly harm the enthusiasm of newbies.
 
So I decided to patch these icon files and add translation (mainly zh_CN) where it is necessary. Currently, following fields have been translated:
 
 * Name
 
 * GenericName
 
 * Comment
 
All these fields were translated directly from their orginally source text. If you think somewhere is improper or incorrect, feel free to report a bug.
